1. VALUING EQUITIES
	1.1 Top-Down Valuation Approach 
		Focuses on the macro factors of the economy, such as GDP, employment, taxation, interest rates, etc. before examining micro factors such as specific sectors or companies. 
		i.e. Economy, market and industry have a significant impact on the total returns for individual stocks:
			- macro-economic analysis 
			- industry analysis 
			
		(*) Macro-economic Analysis
		    (i) A Top-down approach to understanding a business begins with the global economy.
		    (ii) Domestic businesses are rarely isolated and operate as part of the global economy.
			(iii) Domestic economics are very exposed to its domestic condition like growth rate, political stability and currency risk. 
			(e.g russia-ukrian war, covid-19 pandemic, rising inflation and rates )
		(*) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
		    (i) used as single measure of a contry's overall economic activity 
			(ii) measures market value of final goods and services produced domestically. 
			(iii) GDP figures typically expressed in real (inflation adjusted) term, referred to as real GDP growth. 
		(*) Inflation
			(i) Measured using the rate of change of the consumer price index (CPI), which represents the price of a basket of goods and services bought by a typical consumer
			(ii) Moderate inflation (~2%) is good for the economy, by encouraging people to spend rather than save, boosting economic growth
			(iii) High inflation or hyperinflation (>10%), usually due to high money supply growth or political turmoil, is bad. Domestic currency falls, and capital flows to other assets (e.g. Gold) and more stable countries
		(*) Interest Rates
			(i)  Higher growth, inflation tend to lead to higher rates. 
			(ii) Reflect the cost of borrowing
			(iii)Impacts business performances via:
				For the firm:
				- lower inerest rates imply less interest expense and higher profit. 
				- reduces cost of capital and increasing viable investment opportunities. 
				For the customer:
				- lower interest rates reduces the cost of current consumption (e.g. cheaper to buy a car on a loan)
				- increasing sales for businesses. 
			Additional notes: 
			(*) SIBOR versus SOR
			   SIBOR (SG Interbank Offered Rate) – determined by the demand and supply of funds in the SG interbank market
			   SOR (Swap Offer Rate) – derived from USD LIBOR, USD/SGD FX Swap rates. SOR tends to be more volatile
		(*) Fiscal Policy
		    - Government actions that alter the levels of government spending and taxes
			  e.g.Trump reduced US taxes in Dec ‘17, benefiting wealthy individuals.
		(*) Monetary Policy
			- Policy measures by Central Banks.
			-  Interest rate regime is most common
			- Typical stimulative measures when economy is weak is to lower rates, and vice versa
			- Lower rates cheapen cost of borrowing by consumers and businesses, thus encourages consumption and business investments 
		
	1.2 Bottom-up Valuation Approach 
			Bottom-up is an investment approach that focuses on the fundamentals of the individual company rather than the overall macro environment. 
	   i.e findings stokcs that provide superior returns regardless of teh market and industry outlook. 
	       - fundamental analysis
		   - technical analysis 
		   
(*) INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
	- Three primary objectives
		The sensitivity of the industry to key macro factors
		How the industry operates and the key performance metrics
		The competitive structure of the industry
	- Generally, an industry’s prospects within the global business environment determines how well a firm fares, 
	  thus industry analysis precedes company analysis 	
	- Few companies can do well in an industry with poor outlook
	- Global Industry Classification System (GICS) has 11 economic sectors, which are groups of industries that have similar exposure to key economic factors
	- Porter’s Five Forces 
								           Threat of new entrants 
Bargaining power of suppliers 	    (rivarly among existing competitors) 	  Bargaining power of buyers
                                   Thread of substitute products or services 
								   

(*) FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS
 - What is Equities?
 - It is the value of assets owned by company after deducting the value of its liabilities
 - Equities holders’ claim on the company’s assets rank after creditors and bond holders
 - Ordinary Shares – gives owner voting rights and share of profit after obligations, via dividends
 - Preferential Shares – no voting rights, preferred over Ordinary shares in that profit is distributed to them first

 - Valuing Equities
    2 Common stock valuation approaches
    (i) Discounted Cash Flow Techniques
	          Present Value of Cash Flows (PVCF)
        Present Value of Dividends (DDM)
		  - The DDM valuation approach estimates the value of the firm from the dividends that the firm pays
          - The stock value today depends on the dividends the investor expects to receive before the stock is sold
          - The future selling price will depend on future dividends that the stock is expected to distribute

    (ii) Relative Valuation Techniques
	     Financial Ratios - P/E, P/CF, P/BV
		 Objective is to value assets based on how similar assets are currently priced in the market
		 -  Relative valuation is popular because
			(i) Requires less assumptions compared to the DCF models
			(ii) Simpler to understand
			(iii)More reflective of current market valuation
			(iv) Disadvantages of Relative Valuation
			(v) Over/Under-valued – if market is over/under-valuing comparable firms, our relative valuation will similarly be skewed
			(vi) Lack of transparency – underlying assumptions for the variables may not be immediately clear
    		 
			 To determine the value of an economic entity, we compare with similar entities on the basis of several relative ratios that compare its stock price to variables that affect a stock’s value:
				• Earnings – Price/Earnings (P/E)
				• Book Value – Price/Book Value (P/B)
				• Sales – Price/Sale (P/S)
			(i) P/E = Current Market Price / Earnings
			- Analysts could use the most recent past earnings, often referred to as the Trailing 12-months (TTM) Earnings (EPS), and the ratio is sometimes called Trail or Historical P/E
			- Or use expected next year’s earnings, and it will be called Future or Forecast or Forward P/E
			Common choices of benchmark for P/E:
			• Average P/E for the company’s peer group of companies within an industry
			• Average P/E of company’s industry/sector (e.g. GICS)
			• P/E of a representative equity index
				For all the above, get also the average PAST value of the P/Es
			• A stock could then be compared with one similar company, average of the peer group companies, industry, or the representative index – to determine if its over/under valued
			• It should also be compared to its OWN historical P/E
			(ii) P/E-to-Growth (PEG) ratio = (Stock’s P/E) / (expected % earnings growth)
			  i.e How do we adjust for expected earnings growth in P/E?
				• Lower PEG is more attractive, all else equal
				• PEG < 1 is used as a Value indicator sometimes
			(iii) Price to Book Value
				•  “Book Value” refers to the fact that the measurement of value comes from accounting records or books, in contrast to market value
				• Book Value per share reflects the investment that shareholders have made in the company
				• Defined more precisely, we use just common shareholders’ equity (Total Assets minus total liabilities) and also subtract any preferred stock
				• So Book value refers to Book value of Equity
		When to use P/B?
		•  Book Value per share is good for valuing companies composed mainly of liquid assets, such as finance institutions and banks. These companies’ BV may be close to their market values
		• Book Value also used to value companies that are not expected to continue as a going concern 
		• Book Value is generally positive and can be used even when EPS is 0 or negative
		• Book Value is more stable than EPS, so P/B may be more meaningful when EPS is abnormally high or low or highly variable
		 (iv) Price to Sales
		 When to use P/S?
			• Sales are less subject to manipulation than other fundamentals like EPS or Book Value, so P/S paints a different picture to P/E and P/B
			• Sales are positive even when EPS is negative, so can be used at all times
			• Sales is more stable than EPS, so P/S is more meaningful when EPS is abnormally high or low
			• P/S has been viewed as appropriate for valuing stocks of mature, cyclical, and zero-income companies
	    (v) Other Common Valuation Ratios
		• Cash Flow – Price/Cash Flow (P/CF)
		• Dividends – Price/Dividends and Dividend Yield
		• Instead of just using Price of stock, increasingly more are using Enterprise Value
		Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Capitalization + Total Debt – Cash and cash equivalents
	• EV considers financial leverage, and more accurately reflects the takeover cost if a company were to be bought
	• EV/EBITDA is by far the most widely used EV multiple

Relative Valuation
	Using the P/B measure, which of the 3 local banks is the cheapest?
	• Which local bank has the highest dividend yield? 
	• Which local bank stock would you recommend your mother to buy?
